      Discover® Enhanced Decisioning is a fraud product for card-not-present
      (CNP) transactions that enables participants to share enhanced
      authorization data in real time. By sharing enhanced data, the issuer can
      make a more informed decision to either approve or decline a transaction.
      As a result, participants experience higher fraud capture rates, lower
      false positive fraud declines, and increased sales.
